# [Q2. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/how-many-numbers-are-smaller-than-the-current-number/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=dsa-linear-shoal-array-ii)

## Task

Given the array nums, for each nums[i] find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each nums[i] you have to count the number of valid j's such that j != i and nums[j] < nums[i].

Return the answer in an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,1,2,2,3]
Output: [4,0,1,1,3]
Explanation:
For nums[0]=8 there exist four smaller numbers than it (1, 2, 2 and 3).
For nums[1]=1 does not exist any smaller number than it.
For nums[2]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
For nums[3]=2 there exist one smaller number than it (1).
For nums[4]=3 there exist three smaller numbers than it (1, 2 and 2).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,5,4,8]
Output: [2,1,0,3]
Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7]
Output: [0,0,0,0]

Constraints:

2 <= nums.length <= 500
0 <= nums[i] <= 100

## Status:

- Runtime: 0ms (100%)
- Memory: 17.22MB (94.84)

## Approach

- Iterate nums and using a dict store keys and freq
- create and iterate through a sorted list of keys -> dict. value pair would be the number of num that is smaller than key.
- Iterate through nums and create a list, searching the dict for how many nums is smaller than current num.

//surprised that the run time is so fast despite doing so many for loops.
